# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a quick and easy way to edit text on the web. It uses various aplhaneumeric symbols and characters to spice up plain, boring text. It can also be used to help organize text into simple lists, insert images and link URL's. It's a fairly simple tool that anyone can learn to use. Say I wanted to make a word **bold** or *Italic*, or ***both***, simply adding a few characters around what I want to change is all that's needed.

To help emphasize a word, simply use `*` to make text *italicized*, `**` to make words **bold**, or both together to really hit your point ***home*** like this:
  `This is how to make a word **bold** and this is how to give a word *italics*, and both together will ***really*** emphasize a word.`
  
Markdown can also be helpful to present information or to add photos or link webpages. Putting a hyphen before a word will start a simple list. To make a more organised list, try adding a number instead.

Here's a basic reference sheet to help you get stated with markdown!
- `#` creates a heading, making text larger and more prominant
  -`#` is the largest and `######` is the smallest header
- `**` wrapped around text will make it **bold**
- `*` wrapped around text will add *italics*
- `***` wrapped around text will add ***all three***
- `-` preceding a line of text will make an unordered list
- `1.` preceding a line of text will turn it into a numbered, ordered list.
