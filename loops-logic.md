# JavaScript Operators and Loops

Operators and loops are used to add another layer of functionality to your JS scripts. Operators are used to evaluate a situation. An example of an operator would be `=` or `&&`.
Operators commonly will give a true or false feedback, allowing you to sort information better.

There are three types of loops:
* For loops
* While loops
* Do while loops

They all have different functions, but as the name implies they will continue to loop through a block of code until a specified condition is met. Operators can be used to help set these conditions.
