# Structuring pages with HTML

First off, what is HTML? HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It's a code language used primarilly for building web sites. Any web page out there has a bare bones foundation written in HTML. And although it has been around for a very long time, it still remains the standard for web development. It may not make a web page very fancy or add many cool features, but without HTML those cool features would never happen. Now that we know what HTML is, how do we use it? It's time to start writting some code!
