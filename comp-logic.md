Before getting in to the many nuances of writtig computer code, lets first take a look at how computers work. Without a fundamentals of what's going on *inside* the computer, it will be harder to understand the relationship between the code you write and the machine that is supposed to try use tat code. Here are a coulple things to know about the structure and logic of a computer.

### Computer Architecture

Regardless of how different they can be, all computers are basically made upof the same components. Not only that, all computers, regardless of their ultimate purpose, do the same four functions:
1. Take in input
2. Store that input in memory
3. Process that info as data
4. Output the results

The input is the catalyst that makes te computer do stuff. The input is then turned into data and stored on the computer's memory as binary data. That Binary is processed by the CPU. The results of what the CPU processed is converted to physical output.

### Circuts and Logic

The inside of a computer is made up of a few primary components. There are input devices like keyboards, your mouse and cameras. These are used to take in info. Then there is a storage system where that info is kept until needed. There are output devices like screens and speakers. And all of that is controlled by a aster chip called the CPU, or central processing unit. The CPU is made up of lots of tiny components and circuits that are used to send information back and forth between the other components. When new data is recieved through an input device, it is sent to the storage where it can be accessed and processed by the CPU. Circuits are like conduits for data, or binary code. The smaller the CPU, the faster the processing speed it has since there is a smaller distance for for that data to travel. There all all sorts of different types of circits that do specific tasks. By itself, one circuit isn't able to process much data very quickly. But by combining hundreds and even millions of circits together, data can be processed and incredibly fast speeds. This allows your computer to do so many things at once yet take almost no time to do it.

### Hardware and Software

Hardware is the physical components of a computer. Circuits, wires, plugs are all various types of hardware. Software is anything that is essentially made up of data, like games and apps. While a computer speaks to itself and other computers in binary code, which isn't very exciting, thankfully we don't have to deal directly with binary code. With programming languages, we can write code that inputs commands in a language we can understand that tells the computer hardware what binary commands to run. The master program that controls all of the hardware and manages how new software gets on your computer is the operating system. The operating system, or OS, manages all the functions of your computer. So when you are listening to music, surfing the web and trying to type an email, your computer isn't actually running all of those softwares simultaneously. The OS is switching back and forth between various programms at lightning speeds so that the CPU is able to process each one.  

> Computers have the potential to do all kinds of amazing things. But the only thing that makes a computer smart, or useful, is you. When you learn to code you get to define the problem you want to solve, and write the software that turns those ideas into reality. That gives you the power to build the things that matter to you, to your community, and to the world.
