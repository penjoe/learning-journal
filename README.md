## What Growth Mindset?

There are basicaly two different mindsets when it comes to learning:
  1. Fixed mindset
  2. Growth Mindset
  
Fixed mindset is basically a way of thinking that says how I am now is as good as it will ever be. I can't get any smarter or better than I am. A fixed mindset is doomed to perpetual frustration and failure. A growth mindset, on the other hand, says:
>"I can **do** this! I will get better because I *can* get better!"
Someone who has a growth mindset won't give up when the going gets tough. They will continue to struggle against what they do not know until finally the reach success!

## Never forget to maintain a mindset of growth!
1. Never stop learning! Never stop trying to improve yourself.
2. Remember that everything is figureoutable. There is no problem that can't be solved or have some sort of workaround to it.
3. Believe in yourself! You're actually pretty amazing. As Thomas the train says,
>I think I can!

And just as a little bonus, remember that [Google](https://www.google.com) is your friend!

### About the author
My name is Joe Pennock and I've recently decided to give up being a truck driver and try my hand at a career in tech. I've always been a little on the nerdy side but never saw myself as a "techy" guy. Finally, enough friends that work in the tech industry rubbed off on me and here I am! Sitting in Code 102 at Code Fellows! Excited to get this journey started and see how high I can make it!
